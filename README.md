Data set: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gini-coefficient-equivalized-income-chartbook 

This data set is a list of the gini coefficients for various countries between 1956 and 2014. The gini coefficient is intended to measure the income inequality within a country. A coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality, where all wealth values are the same, and a coefficient of 1 represents maximum inequality. Therefore, the decimal value represnts how far a country's economic statistics deviate from a 0 value of perfect equality. This specific dataset uses disposable household income as the primary metric. The data for each country has been equalized after taxes. My program uses a cut down version of this data set, only containing values for Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, and the United States, to get a better idea of how Canada's income inequality compares to a set of other nations usually considered highly developed and prosperous. 

I selected this data because eceonomics has always been a topic that intersested me, and I wanted to examine the social issue of income inequality. The main things I wanted to examine were the questions of "is income inequality actually getting worse over time," and "how does Canada's income inequality compare to other developed nations?" This is because while these are very frequently debated social issues, many people rarely use data to support their opinions. This program makes it easy for people to view the data in an easy to understand format.
